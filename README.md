[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/429173600.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/429173600)

This is ESMA's version (fork) of the TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM). Please refer to [https://github.com/MaREI-EPMG/times-ireland-model](https://github.com/MaREI-EPMG/times-ireland-model) for the original model developed at University College Cork, incl. information about the original contributors, funding sources and usage by UCC. 

## Purpose of the model

The TIMES-Ireland Model has been developed to inform future possible decarbonisation pathways for the Irish energy system. TIM can be used to assess the implications of certain policies, incl. regulatory or technology target-setting.

## Documentation
An open access [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4991-2022) is the main source of documentation for the model.
